## Notes for instructor

I really enjoyed working on this project. I was not able to figure out how to iterate on the shopping list ingredients array because of the way it's structured in local storage (so it looks a little odd on the shopping list page, but the ingredients are there). This course is a stretch for me and I am learning a lot. Thank you!
