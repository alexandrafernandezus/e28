### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
No.

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
One part of the interface I found difficult was the experience when I didn't get an answer correct. I assumed the site would  tell me the correct answer eventually and move on to the next card, but instead, I was forced to keep guessing until I got the answer correct (which was particularly challenging since I don't know German!). Would you consider adding a hint option? Or perhaps a guess limit (e.g. three guesses before the answer is revealed or the card is moved to the back of the stack)? You could incorporate that into your existing v-if/else functionality within your checkGuess method. I also recommend adding a sentence or two on your home page that explains what the purpose of the website is.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
I didn't see any comments, and generally I found your code to be self-evident. You selected good names for your components, methods, props, etc., so I was able to follow along. It might make sense to add a few lines of comments though - for me, the hardest thing to follow were the methods on DeckPage.vue (some were related to local storage).

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
Your code helped reinforce some of the key information we have learned in the course. It was useful to see how someone else went about structuring their application. The most challenging item for me in this course is thinking about how to nest the different pieces of an application, and I think you approached that in a really straightforward way (e.g. DeckPage > Gameboard > ResetProgressButton).

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
No.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
Phil - I thought you did a great job with this flashcard site. I thought the functionality worked really well - I liked how I could return to a deck and pick up where I left off. I thought your code was well written and easy to follow.
