*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
One part of the interface I found difficult was the experience when you didn't get an answer correct. I assumed the site would  tell me the answer and move on to the next card, but instead, I was forced to keep guessing until I got the answer right (which was particularly challenging since I don't know German!). Would you consider adding a hint option? Or perhaps a guess limit (e.g. three guesses before the answer is revealed?). You could incoporate that into your existing v-if/v-else functionality.

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
No. In fact, you made great use of props and computed properties.

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
Phil - I thought you did a great job with this flashcard site. I thought the functionality worked really well - I liked how I could return to a deck and pick up where I left off. I thought your code was well written and easy to follow.
